For a more robust signal, you might want to combine the slope with other pieces of information. Here are a few suggestions:

Full Price History Logging:

Instead of summarizing the trend with just the slope, you could log all historical points for a given window. This way, you could later perform more advanced analyses (like detecting patterns, computing volatility, or other technical indicators).

Additional Indicators:

Moving Average (MA): A simple average of prices over a set period. It smooths out short-term fluctuations.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Helps visualize changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.

Volatility Indicators: Such as Bollinger Bands or the standard deviation of price changes, to measure how much the price fluctuates.

Combining Features:

You might log both the slope and the raw price points. Later, when training a predictive model, you can let the model decide which features (slope, price history, MA, RSI, etc.) are most important.

For example, you might create a data structure that, for each trade, includes:

The slope computed from the recent candles.

A list of all closing prices over that period.

Other indicators (if computed) like the moving average, RSI, etc.

This gives your learning algorithm more context and can help improve predictive performance.
